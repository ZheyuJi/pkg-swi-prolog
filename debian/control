Package: swi-prolog
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Recommends: swi-prolog-doc, swi-prolog-xpce
Suggests: prolog-el
Description: Prolog interpreter
 ISO/Edinburgh-style Prolog compiler.  Compliant with Part 1 of the ISO standard
 for Prolog.  Covers all traditional Edinburgh Prolog features and shares many
 features with Quintus and SICStus Prolog, including a compatible module system.
 Very fast compiler, garbage collection (also on atoms), fast and powerful C/C++
 interface, autoloading, GNU-readline interface.
 .
 SWI-Prolog has been designed and implemented such that it can easily be
 modified for experiments with logic programming and the relation
 between logic programming and other programming paradigms (such as the
 object oriented XPCE environment).  SWI-Prolog has a rich set of
 built-in predicates and reasonable performance, which makes it possible
 to develop substantial applications in it.  The current version offers
 a module system, garbage collection and an interface to the C language.

Package: swi-prolog-clib
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, swi-prolog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Interface to system library for SWI Prolog
 This library contains SWI-Prolog foreign-libraries to deal with various
 OS-dependent or obscure stuff from SWI-Prolog.

Package: swi-prolog-http
Architecture: any
Depends: swi-prolog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Interface to system library for SWI Prolog
 This package provides some Prolog libraries for accessing and
 providing HTTP services.  The services are intended to realise embedded
 servers and form the basis for agent-protocols such as FIPA and SOAP.

Package: swi-prolog-semweb
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, swi-prolog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Interface to system library for SWI Prolog
 The semweb library provides a Prolog library based on foreign-language
 extensions for storing and manipulating RDF triples.  It can handle quite
 large sets of triples only limited by available memory.  One million
 triples requires about 80MB memory, so a fully equiped 32-bit machine
 can handle about 40 million triples.

Package: swi-prolog-sgml
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, swi-prolog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: SGML/XML/HTML parser for SWI Prolog
 This package allows you to parse SGML, XML and HTML data into a Prolog 
 data structure.  The high-level interface defined in sgml 
 provides access at the file-level, while the low-level interface defined
 in the foreign module works with Prolog streams.

Package: swi-prolog-table
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, swi-prolog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Managing external tables for SWI Prolog
 This package provides a foreign language extension to SWI-Prolog
 for the manipulation of 'external tables'.  External tables are files 
 using a textual representation of records separated into fields.  The 
 package allows for a flexible definition of the format of the file in 
 terms of records and fields, how the information in the file should be 
 mapped onto Prolog data types and what properties the file has to 
 improve the performance of lookup.

Package: swi-prolog-xpce
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, swi-prolog (= ${binary:Version})
Description: GUI library for SWI Prolog
 XPCE is an object-oriented symbolic programming environment for User 
 Interfaces.  XPCE was designed to be language-independent.  In practice it has 
 gained popularity with Prolog and many useful libraries are now available for 
 Prolog only.  Therefore we will often talk about XPCE/Prolog.
