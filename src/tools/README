This directory contains tools developed to  find the consequences of the
stack-shifter. This tool-chain is designed   for  GNU/Linux systems. The
main program is update-deps. It is used as follows:

    * Add -dr to COFLAGS and the Makefile and recompile.  This causes
    GCC to generate RTL-dumps of the compiler in addition to its normal
    output.

    * Run ./update-deps *.expand. This generates file.c.tree, which
    represents the call-tree (in Prolog format) and file.c.functions,
    which represents the line-range for functions, including virtual
    machine instruction implementations (VMI(...)) and predicates
    (PRED_IMPL(...)).

    * Use analysis.pl to find problematic code fragments.
