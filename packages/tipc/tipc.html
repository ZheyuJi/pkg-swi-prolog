<P>These pages are not intended as a comprehensive tutorial in the use 
of TIPC services. The TIPC Programmer's Guide,
<A class="url" href="http://tipc.sf.net/doc/Programmers_Guide.txt">http://tipc.sf.net/doc/Programmers_Guide.txt</A>, 
provides assistance to developers who are creating applications that 
utilize TIPC services. The TIPC User's Guide, <A class="url" href="http://tipc.sf.net/doc/Users_Guide.txt">http://tipc.sf.net/doc/Users_Guide.txt</A>, 
provides an administrator of a TIPC cluster with the information needed 
to operate one. A TIPC server loadable module, that may be used to make 
a host available as a TIPC enabled node, has been a part of the Linux 
kernel since 2.6.16. Please see: <A class="url" href="http://tipc.sf.net">http://tipc.sf.net</A>

<H3><A NAME="sec:1.1"><SPAN class="sec-nr">1.1</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Overview</SPAN></A></H3>

<P>In a TIPC network, a Node is comprised of a collection of lightweight 
threads of execution operating in the same process, or heavyweight 
processes operating on the same machine. A Cluster is a collection of 
Nodes operating on different machines, and operating indirectly by way 
of a local Ethernet or other networking medium. Clusters may be further 
aggregated into Zones, and Zones into Networks. The address space of two 
TIPC networks is completely disjoint. Zones on different networks may 
coexist on the same LAN but they may not communicate directly with one 
another.

<P>TIPC provides connectionless, connection-oriented, reliable, and 
unreliable forwarding strategies for both stream and message oriented 
applications. But not all strategies can be used in every application. 
For example, there is no such thing as a multicast byte stream. The 
strategy is selected by the user for the application when the socket is 
instantiated.

<P>TIPC is not TCP/IP based. Consequently, it cannot signal beyond a 
local network span without some kind of tunneling mechanism. TIPC is 
designed to facilitate deployment of distributed applications, where 
certain aspects of the application may be segregated, and then delegated 
and/or duplicated over several machines on the same LAN. The application 
is unaware of the topology of the network on which it is running. It 
could be a few threads operating in the same process, several processes 
operating on the same machine, or it could be dozens or even hundreds of 
machines operating on the same LAN, all operating as a unit. TIPC 
manages all of this complexity so that the programmer doesn't have to.

<P>Unlike TCP/IP, TIPC does not assign network addresses to network 
interfaces; it assigns addresses (e.g. port-ids) to sockets when they 
are instantiated. The address is unique and persists only as long as the 
socket persists. A single Node therefore, may typically have many TIPC 
addresses active at any one time, each assigned to an active socket. 
TIPC also provides a means that a process can use to bind a socket to a 
well-known address (e.g. a service). Several peers may bind to the same 
well-known address, thereby enabling multi-server topologies. And server 
members may exist anywhere in the Zone. TIPC manages the distribution of 
client requests among the membership of the server group. A server 
instance responds to two addresses: its public well-known address that 
it is bound to, and that a client may use to establish a communication 
with a service, and its private address that the server instance may use 
to directly interact with a client instance.

<P>TIPC also enables multicast and "publish and subscribe" regimes that 
applications may use to facilitate asynchronous exchange of datagrams 
with a number of anonymous sources that may come and go over time. One 
such regime is implemented as a naming service managed by a distributed 
topology server. The topology server provides surveillance on the 
comings and goings of publishers, with advice to interested subscribers 
in the form of event notifications, emitted when a publisher's status 
changes. For example, when a server application binds to a TIPC address 
, that address is automatically associated with that server instance in 
topology server's name table. This has the side effect of causing a 
"published" event to be emitted to all interested subscribers. 
Conversely, when the server's socket is closed or when one of its 
addresses is released using the "no-scope" option of <A class="pred" href="#tipc_bind/3">tipc_bind/3</A>, 
a "withdrawn" event is emitted. See <A class="pred" href="#tipc_service_port_monitor/2">tipc_service_port_monitor/2</A>.

<P>A client application may connect to the topology server in order to 
interrogate the name table to determine whether or not a service is 
present before actually committing to access it. See
<A class="pred" href="#tipc_service_exists/2">tipc_service_exists/2</A> 
and <A class="pred" href="#tipc_service_probe/2">tipc_service_probe/2</A>. 
Another way that the topology server can be applied is exemplified in 
Erlang's "worker/supervisor" behavioral pattern. A supervisor thread has 
no other purpose than to monitor a collection of worker threads in order 
to ensure that a service is available and able to serve a common goal. 
When a worker under the supervisor's care dies, the supervisor receives 
the worker's "withdrawn" event, and takes some action to instantiate a 
replacement. The predicate, <A class="pred" href="#tipc_service_port_monitor/2">tipc_service_port_monitor/2</A>, 
is provided specifically for this purpose. Using the service is 
optional. It has applications in distributed, high-availability, 
fault-tolerant, and non-stop systems.

<P>Adding capacity to a cluster becomes an administrative function 
whereby new server hardware is added to a TIPC network, then the desired 
application is launched on the new server. The application binds to its 
well-known address, thereby joining in the Cluster. TIPC will 
automatically begin sending work to it. An administrator has tools for 
gracefully removing a server from a Cluster, without effecting the 
traffic moving on the Cluster.

<P>An administrator may configure a Node to have two or more network 
interfaces. Provided that each interface is invisible to the other, TIPC 
will manage them as a redundant group, thus enabling high-reliability 
network features such as automatic link fail-over and hot-swap.

<DT><STRONG>name</STRONG>(<VAR>+Type, +Instance, +Domain</VAR>)</DT>
<DD class="defbody">
A TIPC name address is used by servers to advertise themselves as 
services in unicast applications, and is used by clients to connect to 
unicast services. Type, Instance, and Domain are positive integers that 
are unique to a service.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>name_seq</STRONG>(<VAR>+Type, +Lower, +Upper</VAR>)</DT>
<DD class="defbody">
A TIPC name-sequence address is used by servers to advertise themselves 
as services in multicast and "publish and subscribe" applications. Lower 
and Upper represent a range of instance addresses. Each server will 
receive exactly one datagram from a client that sends a name-sequence 
address that matches the server's Type, and where its Lower and Upper 
instance range intersects the Lower and Upper instance range bound to 
the server. Clients may send a datagram to any and all interested 
servers by providing an appropriate name-sequence address to <A class="pred" href="#tipc_send/4">tipc_send/4</A>.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>port_id</STRONG>(<VAR>+Ref, +Node</VAR>)</DT>
<DD class="defbody">
A TIPC port-id is the socket's private address. It is ephemeral in 
nature. It persists only as long as the socket instance persists. Port 
ids are generally provided to applications via <A class="pred" href="#tipc_receive/4">tipc_receive/4</A>. 
An application may discover its own port_id for a socket using
<A class="pred" href="#tipc_get_name/2">tipc_get_name/2</A>. Generally, 
others cannot discover the port-id of a socket, except by receiving 
messages originated from it. A server responds to a client by providing 
the received port-id as the sender address in a reply message. The 
client will receive the server's port-id via his own <A class="pred" href="#tipc_receive/4">tipc_receive/4</A>. 
The client can then interact with a specific server instance without 
having to perform any additional address resolution. The client simply 
sends all subsequent messages related to a specific transaction to the 
server instance using the port-id received from the server in its 
replies.

<P>Sometimes the socket's port-id alone is enough to establish an ad-hoc 
session anonymously between parent and child processes. The parent 
instantiates a socket, then forks into two processes. The child 
retrieves the port-id of the parent from the socket inherited from the 
parent using <A class="pred" href="#tipc_get_name/2">tipc_get_name/2</A>, 
then closes the socket and instantiates a socket of its own. The child 
sends a message to the parent, on its own socket, using the parent's 
port-id as the destination address. The port-id received by the parent 
is unique to a specific instance of child. The handshake is complete; 
each side knows who the other is, and two-way communication may now 
proceed. A one-way communication (e.g. a message oriented pipe or 
mailbox) is also possible using only the socket inherited from the 
parent, provided that there is exactly one sender and one receiver on 
the socket. Both parent and child use the socket's own port-id, one side 
adopts the role of sender, and the other of receiver.

<P>Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) provides a flexible, 
reliable, fault-tolerant, high-speed, and low-overhead framework for 
inter-process communication between federations of trusted peers, 
operating as a unit. It was developed by Ericsson AB, as a means to 
provide for communications between Common Control Systems processes and 
Network Element peers in telephone switching systems, sometimes 
operating at arm's length on different line cards or mainframes. 
Delegation of responsibility in this way is one of the fundamental

<P>SWI-Prolog's broadcast library provides a means that may be used to 
facilitate publish and subscribe communication regimes between anonymous 
members of a community of interest. The members of the community are 
however, necessarily limited to a single instance of Prolog. The TIPC 
broadcast library removes that restriction. With this library loaded, 
any member of a TIPC network that also has this library loaded may hear 
and respond to your broadcasts. Using TIPC Broadcast, it becomes a 
nearly trivial matter to build an instance of supercomputer that 
researchers within the High Performance Computer community refer to as 
"Beowulf Class Cluster Computers."

<P>This module has no public predicates. When this module is 
initialized, it does three things:

<P>
<UL class="latex">
<LI>It starts a listener daemon thread that listens for broadcasts from 
others, received as TIPC datagrams, and
<LI>It registers three listeners: <SPAN class="pred-ext">tipc_node/1</SPAN>, <SPAN class="pred-ext">tipc_cluster/1</SPAN>, 
and
<SPAN class="pred-ext">tipc_zone/1</SPAN>, and
<LI>It registers three listeners: <SPAN class="pred-ext">tipc_node/2</SPAN>, <SPAN class="pred-ext">tipc_cluster/2</SPAN>, 
and
<SPAN class="pred-ext">tipc_zone/2</SPAN>.
</UL>

<P>A <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast/1</SPAN> or <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> 
that is not directed to one of the six listeners above, behaves as usual 
and is confined to the instance of Prolog that originated it. But when 
so directed, the broadcast will be sent to all participating systems, 
including itself, by way of TIPC's multicast addressing facility. A TIPC 
broadcast or broadcast request takes the typical form: <CODE>broadcast(tipc_node(+Term, +Timeout))</CODE>. 
The principal functors <CODE>tipc_node</CODE>, <CODE>tipc_cluster</CODE>, 
and
<CODE>tipc_zone</CODE>, specify the scope of the broadcast. The functor
<CODE>tipc_node</CODE>, specifies that the broadcast is to be confined 
to members of a present TIPC node. Likewise, <CODE>tipc_cluster</CODE> 
and <CODE>tipc_zone</CODE>, specify that the traffic should be confined 
to members of a present TIPC cluster and zone, respectively. To prevent 
the potential for feedback loops, the scope qualifier is stripped from 
the message before transmission. The timeout is optional. It specifies 
the amount to time to wait for replies to arrive in response to a 
broadcast_request. The default period is 0.250 seconds. The timeout is 
ignored for broadcasts.

<P>An example of three separate processes cooperating on the same Node:

<PRE class="code">
Process A:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(1, 5, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process B:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(7, 9, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process C:

   ?- findall(X, broadcast_request(tipc_node(number(X))), Xs).
   Xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].

   ?-
</PRE>

<P>It is also possible to carry on a private dialog with a single 
responder. To do this, you supply a compound of the form, Term:PortId, 
to a TIPC scoped <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast/1</SPAN> or <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN>, 
where PortId is the port-id of the intended listener. If you supply an 
unbound variable, PortId, to broadcast_request, it will be unified with 
the address of the listener that responds to Term. You may send a 
directed broadcast to a specific member by simply providing this address 
in a similarly structured compound to a TIPC scoped <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast/1</SPAN>. 
The message is sent via unicast to that member only by way of the 
member's broadcast listener. It is received by the listener just as any 
other broadcast would be. The listener does not know the difference.

<P>Although this capability is needed under some circumstances, it has a 
tendency to compromise the resilience of the broadcast model. You should 
not rely on it too heavily, or fault tolerance will suffer.

<P>For example, in order to discover who responded with a particular 
value:

<PRE class="code">
Process A:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(1, 3, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process B:

   ?- listen(number(X), between(7, 9, X)).
   true.

   ?-

Process C:

   ?- broadcast_request(tipc_node(number(X):From)).
   X = 7,
   From = port_id('&lt;1.1.1:3971170279&gt;') ;
   X = 8,
   From = port_id('&lt;1.1.1:3971170279&gt;') ;
   X = 9,
   From = port_id('&lt;1.1.1:3971170279&gt;') ;
   X = 1,
   From = port_id('&lt;1.1.1:3971170280&gt;') ;
   X = 2,
   From = port_id('&lt;1.1.1:3971170280&gt;') ;
   X = 3,
   From = port_id('&lt;1.1.1:3971170280&gt;') ;
   false.

<H4><A NAME="sec:2.2.1"><SPAN class="sec-nr">2.2.1</SPAN> <SPAN class="sec-title">Caveats:</SPAN></A></H4>

<P>While the implementation is mostly transparent, there are some 
important and subtle differences that must be taken into consideration:

<P>
<UL class="latex">
<LI>TIPC broadcast now requires an initialization step in order to 
launch the broadcast listener daemon. See <A class="pred" href="#tipc_initialize/0">tipc_initialize/0</A>.
<LI>Prolog's <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> is 
nondet. It sends the request, then evaluates the replies synchronously, 
backtracking as needed until a satisfactory reply is received. The 
remaining potential replies are not evaluated. This is not so when TIPC 
is involved.
<LI>A TIPC <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast/1</SPAN> is completely 
asynchronous.
<LI>A TIPC <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> is 
partially synchronous. A
<SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> is sent, then the 
sender balks for a period of time (default: 250 ms) while the replies 
are collected. Any reply that is received after this period is silently 
discarded. An optional second argument is provided so that a sender may 
specify more (or less) time for replies.
<LI>Replies are <I>no longer</I> collected using <SPAN class="pred-ext">findall/3</SPAN>. 
Replies are presented to the user as a choice point on arrival, until 
the broadcast request timer finally expires. This change allows traffic 
to propagate through the system faster and provides the requestor with 
the opportunity to terminate a broadcast request early if desired, by 
simply cutting choice points.
<LI>Please beware that broadcast request transactions will now remain 
active and resources consumed until broadcast_request finally fails on 
backtracking, an uncaught exception occurs, or until choice points are 
cut. Failure to properly manage this will likely result in chronic 
exhaustion of TIPC sockets.
<LI>If a listener is connected to a generator that always succeeds (e.g. 
a random number generator), then the broadcast request will never 
terminate and trouble is bound to ensue.
<LI><SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> with TIPC scope is <I>not</I> 
reentrant (at least, not now anyway). If a listener performs a <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> 
with TIPC scope recursively, then disaster looms certain. This caveat 
does not apply to a TIPC scoped <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast/1</SPAN>, 
which can safely be performed from a listener context.
<LI>TIPC's capacity is not infinite. While TIPC can tolerate substantial 
bursts of activity, it is designed for short bursts of small messages. 
It can tolerate several thousand replies in response to a <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> 
without trouble, but it will begin to encounter congestion beyond that. 
And in congested conditions, things will start to become unreliable as 
TIPC begins prioritizing and/or discarding traffic.
<LI>A TIPC <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> term that 
is grounded is considered to be a broadcast only. No replies are 
collected unless the there is at least one unbound variable to unify.
<LI>A TIPC <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast/1</SPAN> always succeeds, 
even if there are no listeners.
<LI>A TIPC <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> that 
receives no replies will fail.
<LI>Replies may be coming from many different places in the network (or 
none at all). No ordering of replies is implied.
<LI>Prolog terms are sent to others after first converting them to atoms 
using <SPAN class="pred-ext">term_to_atom/2</SPAN>. Passing real numbers 
this way may result in a substantial truncation of precision. See prolog 
flag option, 'float_format', of <SPAN class="pred-ext">current_prolog_flag/2</SPAN>.

<P>This module provides a replicated data store that is coordinated 
using a variation on Lamport's Paxos concensus protocol. The original 
method is described in his paper entitled, "The Part-time Parliament", 
which was published in 1998. The algorithm is tolerant of non-Byzantine 
failure. That is late or lost delivery or reply, but not senseless 
delivery or reply. The present algorithm takes advantage of the 
convenience offered by multicast to the quorum's membership, who can 
remain anonymous and who can come and go as they please without 
effecting Liveness or Safety properties.

<P>Paxos' quorum is a set of one or more attentive members, whose 
processes respond to queries within some known time limit (<VAR>&lt;</VAR> 
20ms), which includes roundtrip delivery delay. This property is easy to 
satisfy given that every coordinator is necessarily a member of the 
quorum as well, and a quorum of one is permitted. An inattentive member 
(e.g. one whose actions are late or lost) is deemed to be "not-present" 
for the purposes of the present transaction and consistency cannot be 
assured for that member. As long as there is at least one attentive 
member of the quorum, then persistence of the database is assured.

<P>Each member maintains a ledger of terms along with information about 
when they were originally recorded. The member's ledger is 
deterministic. That is to say that there can only be one entry per 
functor/arity combination. No member will accept a new term proposal 
that has a line number that is equal-to or lower-than the one that is 
already recorded in the ledger.

<P>Paxos is a three-phase protocol:
<BLOCKQUOTE> 1: A coordinator first prepares the quorum for a new 
proposal by broadcasting a proposed term. The quorum responds by 
returning the last known line number for that functor/arity combination 
that is recorded in their respective ledgers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 2: The coordinator selects the highest line number it 
receives, increments it by one, and then asks the quorum to finally 
accept the new term with the new line number. The quorum checks their 
respective ledgers once again and if there is still no other ledger 
entry for that functor/arity combination that is equal-to or higher than 
the specified line, then each member records the term in the ledger at 
the specified line. The member indicates consent by returning the 
specified line number back to the coordinator. If consent is withheld by 
a member, then the member returns a <CODE>nack</CODE> instead. The 
coordinator requires unanimous consent. If it isn't achieved then the 
proposal fails and the coordinator must start over from the beginning.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 3: Finally, the coordinator concludes the successful 
negotiation by broadcasting the agreement to the quorum in the form of a
<CODE>paxos_changed(Term)</CODE> event. This is the only event that 
should be of interest to user programs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For practical reasons, we rely on the partially synchronous behavior 
(e.g. limited upper time bound for replies) of <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> 
over TIPC to ensure Progress. Perhaps more importantly, we rely on the 
fact that the TIPC broadcast listener state machine guarantees the 
atomicity of <SPAN class="pred-ext">broadcast_request/1</SPAN> at the 
process level, thus obviating the need for external mutual exclusion 
mechanisms.

<P><I>Note that this algorithm does not guarantee the rightness of the 
value proposed. It only guarantees that if successful, the value 
proposed is identical for all attentive members of the quorum.</I>

<P><I>Note also that tipc_paxos now requires an initialization step. See <A class="pred" href="#tipc_initialize/0">tipc_initialize/0</A>.</I>

<P>Linda is a framework for building systems that are composed of 
programs that cooperate among themselves in order to realize a larger 
goal. A Linda application is composed of two or more processes acting in 
concert. One process acts as a server and the others act as clients. 
Fine-grained communications between client and server is provided by way 
of message passing over sockets and support networks, TIPC sockets in 
this case. Clients interact indirectly by way of the server. The server 
is in principle an eraseable blackboard that clients can use to write (<A class="pred" href="#out/1">out/1</A>), 
read (<A class="pred" href="#rd/1">rd/1</A>) and remove (<A class="pred" href="#in/1">in/1</A>) 
messages called <I>tuples.</I> Some predicates will fail if a requested 
tuple is not present on the blackboard. Others will block until a tuple 
instance becomes available. Tuple instances are made available to 
clients by writing them on the blackboard using <A class="pred" href="#out/1">out/1</A>.

<P>In TIPC Linda, there is a subtle difference between the <CODE>in</CODE> 
and the
<CODE>rd</CODE> predicates that is worth noting. The <CODE>in</CODE> 
predicates succeed exactly once for each tuple placed in the tuple 
space. The tuple is provided to exactly one requesting client. Clients 
can contend for tuples in this way, thus enabling multi-server 
operations. The <CODE>rd</CODE> predicates succeed nondeterministically, 
providing all matching tuples in the tuple space at a given time to the 
requesting client as a choice point without disturbing them.

<P>TIPC Linda is inspired by and adapted from the SICStus Prolog API. 
But unlike SICStus TCP Linda, TIPC Linda is connectionless. There is no 
specific session between client and server. The server receives and 
responds to datagrams originated by clients in an epiperiodic manner.

<P>Example: A simple producer-consumer.

<P>In client 1:

<PRE class="code">
init_producer :-
       linda_client(global),
       producer.

producer :-
       produce(X),
       out(p(X)),
       producer.

produce(X) :- .....
</PRE>

<P>In client 2:

<PRE class="code">
init_consumer :-
        linda_client(global),
        consumer.

consumer :-
       in(p(A)),
       consume(A),
       consumer.

consume(A) :- .....
</PRE>

<P>Example: Synchronization

<PRE class="code">
       ...,
       in(ready),  %Waits here until someone does out(ready)
       ...,
</PRE>

<P>Example: A critical region

<PRE class="code">
       ...,
       in(region_free),  % wait for region to be free
       critical_part,
       out(region_free), % let next one in
       ...,
</PRE>

<P>Example: Reading global data

<PRE class="code">
       ...,
       rd(data(Data)),
       ...,
</PRE>

<P>or, without blocking:

<PRE class="code">
       ...,
       (rd_noblock(data(Data)) -&gt;
             do_something(Data)
       ;     write('Data not available!'),nl
       ),
       ...,
</PRE>

<P>Example: Waiting for any one of several events

<PRE class="code">
       ...,
       in([e(1),e(2),...,e(n)], E),
%  Here is E instantiated to the first tuple that became available
       ...,
</PRE>

<P>Example: Producers and Consumers in the same process using <CODE>linda_eval</CODE> 
threads and/or <CODE>tuple</CODE> predicates

<PRE class="code">
  consumer1 :-
        repeat,
        in([p(_), quit], Y),
        (   Y = p(Z) -&gt; writeln(consuming(Z)); !),
        fail.

  producer1 :-
        forall(between(1,40, X), out(p(X))).

  producer_consumer1 :-
        linda_eval(consumer1),
        call_cleanup(producer1, out(quit)), !.
%
%
  consumer2 :-
       between(1,4,_),
       in_noblock(p(X)), !,
       writeln(consuming(X)),
       consumer2.

  producer2 :-
        linda_eval(p(X), between(1,40, X)).

  producer_consumer2 :-
        producer2,
        linda_eval(consumer2), !.
%
%
  consumer3 :-
        forall(rd_noblock(p(X)), writeln(consuming(X))).

  producer3 :-
        tuple(p(X), between(1,40, X)).

<P><B>Joining Threads:</B> Threads created using linda_eval/(1-2) are

choice-points. Goals are evaluated using <SPAN class="pred-ext">forall/2</SPAN>. 
They are expected to provide nondeterministic behavior. That is they may 
succeed zero or more times on backtracking. They must however, 
eventually fail or succeed deterministically. Otherwise, the thread will 
hang, which will eventually hang the parent thread. Cutting choice 
points in the parent's body has the effect of joining all children 
created by the parent. This provides a barrier that guarantees that all 
child instances of <VAR>Goal</VAR> have run to completion before the 
parent proceeds. Detached threads behave as above, except that they 
operate independently and cannot be joined. They will continue to run 
while the host process continues to run.

On reference, <VAR>Goal</VAR> is executed by a separate thread of

<P><B>Note:</B> A virtual tuple is an extension of the server. Even

operations, but it is unsafe for them to perform any variant of <CODE>in</CODE> 
or <CODE>rd</CODE>, either directly or indirectly. This restriction is 
however, relaxed if the server and client are operating in separate 
heavyweight processes (not threads) on the node or cluster. This is most 
easily achieved by starting a stand-alone Linda server somewhere on the 
cluster. See
